Few questions to ask our Adviser's during our first consultation meeting with them:


  1. Ask for backing up techniques for us not to lose our progress in case we break our instances (feel nako git ang ipagamit -Dindo hahaha).
  2. According to our case study guidelines it was written in there that we have 1 hr consultation hours per week.
     And there are 3 advisers so does this means we have 3 hrs in total per week and 1 hr-call per adviser?
  3. Ask for adviser's consultation hours. Are the weekends off-limits?
  4. Is there a need for us to use our own money for this project, like hosting if there is any or storage purchase if applicable.
  5. Can u tell us please how to initiate the project, like where to start and on what part of the project should we focus more and where is the hardest part.

Feel free to add more
