Few questions to ask our Adviser's during our first consultation meeting with them:


  1. Ask for backing up techniques for us not to lose our progress in case we break our instances.
  2. According to our case study guidelines it was written in there that we have 1 hr consultation hours per week.
     And there are 3 advisers so does this means we have 3 hrs in total per week and 1 hr-call per adviser?
  3. Ask for adviser's consultation hours. Are the weekends off-limits?

Feel free to add more
